## X-Stage Installation

Familiarize yourself with the stage's normal operation.

Building on that foundation, we make a few modifications to the X-Stage to support the LED pole.

- A power and data cable connected to the bottom of the pole is routed through a notch created in one of the stage plates. 

- Connections are made under the stage to a DC power supply and a PoleFX Player via ethernet.

- A cover is then positioned around the pole to protect the cable. 

## X-Stage Modifications

### Bearing Unit Bolts

We provide three <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/91239A512/">M10 button head screws</a> to replace the stock set screws that fasten the bearing unit to the stage frame.
<br>

These bolts prevent the base of the pole and input cable from spinning. 
<br>

### Pole Retaining Set Screw Replacement

The existing set screws that tighten into the pole are replaced with longer <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/91390A143/">M8 x 1.25 mm thread, 16 mm long set screws</a>

### Bearing Size Adapter

The bearing size adapter is inserted into the bearing unit to adapt the 45mm (1.77") bearing to the 1.5" diameter pole.

### Floor plate notch

One of the floor plates requires a notch added to the inner edge to allow the pole's cables to tunnel under the stage. Stages provided by PoleFX will already have this modification, and individual modified platforms can be provided.

### Cable cover

This cover protects the input cable in the exposed section between the notch in the stage plate and the pole.

## X-Stage Reminders
  - Prior to every use, make sure the screws are tight.
  <br>
  - Tighten the 2 Static/Spin hex screws and set your pole to ‘STATIC’ mode prior to removal. If it is in spinning mode, the pole cannot be removed. 
  <br>
  - Do not lift or carry the X-Stage by the plates, this will damage the sprring catch pins. 
  <br>
  - Do not drag/slide the X-Stage, this will damage the rubber feet. 
  <br>
  - Do not try to remove the pole when in spinning mode, damage will occur. .
