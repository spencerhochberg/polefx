## Overview


The PoleFX freestanding pole mounts in the [X-Stage Lite by X-Pole](https://xpoleus.com/shop-all/stages/xstage-lite/x-stage-lite/).

Refer to the [X-Stage Lite Manual](/assets/devices/freestanding/XStage-Manual-2015-April.pdf) to familiarize yourself with the stage's normal operation.

A power and data cable comes out just above the stage platform and is held stationary by engaging with one of the holes in the bearing carrier.

Connections are made under the stage to a DC power supply and a PoleFX Player via ethernet.

## X-Stage Modifications

### X-Stage Bearing Unit Bolts

We provide three <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/91239A512/">M10 button head screws</a> to replace the stock set screws that fasten the bearing unit to the stage frame.
<br>

These bolts provide an anchor to keep the input wiring section of the pole stationary. 
<br>

### Set Screw Replacement

The existing set screws that tighten into the pole are replaced with longer <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/91390A143/">M8 x 1.25 mm thread, 16 mm long set screws</a>


### Bearing Adapter

The bearing adapter is inserted into the bearing unit to adapt the 45mm (1.77") bearing to the 1.5" diameter pole.

### Floor plate notch

One of the floor plates requires a notch added to the inner edge to allow the pole's cables to tunnel under the stage. Stages provided by PoleFX will already have this modification, and individual modified platforms can be provided.

### Cable cover

This circular cover protects the input cable in the exposed section between the notch in the stage plate and the pole.
