## Overview

The pole with stage bearing unit are handled as a single piece to be inserted into the stage frame. 

A power and data cable comes out just above the stage platform and is held stationary by engaging with one of the holes in the bearing carrier.

Connections are made under the stage to a DC power supply and a PoleFX Player via ethernet.

## Installation

The freestanding pole mounts in the [X-Stage Lite by X-Pole](https://xpoleus.com/shop-all/stages/xstage-lite/x-stage-lite/).

Some of the following images and descriptions are taken from the [X-Stage Lite Manual](/assets/devices/freestanding/XStage-Manual-2015-April.pdf), refer to the full manual for more details.

  <summary><strong>Assembly of main stage frame</strong></summary>
  The Main Stage Frame is built up of 6 sub-frames that fan out to form a star structure. Position the Main Stage Frame in the centre of the dance/exercise area; ensure the assembly is the correct way up (Fig.8.1).

  Locate Sub-Frame No.1 (Fig.8.1) the one secured with screws top & bottom to the plates so that it cannot move. As you fan out the base to form a star shape, lift each sub-frame so that it does not drag on the floor (Fig.8.2).

  <summary><strong>Floor plate notch</strong></summary>
  One of the floor plates requires a notch added to the inner edge to allow the pole's cables to tunnel under the stage. Stages provided by PoleFX will already have this modification, and individual modified platforms can be provided.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Fitting the floor plates</strong></summary>
  If you examine one of the Floor Plates, you will see that there are two Spring Catches on its underside, located at each corner of the longer curved surface. Test the operation of the Spring Catches (Fig.9.1) before assembling to the Main Stage Frame.
<br><br>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/devices/freestanding/xstage_floorplates.png" alt="Stage Floorplates">
  <br><br>
    Lay the stage plate down on its face, then rotate the pin arm till it is vertical and the pin will move outwards. Each spring catch is spring loaded so that when you release it (turn it through 90 degrees), a pin will stick out of the edge of the floor plate and remain sticking out until you re-secure it. This is a safety feature to ensure that the Spring Catches do not accidentally retract in use, releasing the Floor Plates. The Spring Catches insert into the Floor Plate Locating Pin Holes (Fig.9.2) – together these are designed to secure each floor plate to the Main Stage Frame.
<br><br>
  
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/devices/freestanding/xstage_floorplates2.png" alt="Stage Floorplates">
  <br><br>
  For the purpose of this illustration, we are installing in an anti/counter-clockwise direction, but you can assemble in a clockwise direction if you prefer, it does not matter which. However, you must start at SubFrame No.1 and continue in the same direction. To fit a floor plate, position the end with the smallest curve towards the Main Stage Frame, with the left edge over Sub-Frame No.1 (the one secured with a hex screw to the base plate). The smaller end of the Floor Plate will slide under the Upper Centre Plate (Fig.9.3).

  <br>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/devices/freestanding/xstage_floorplates3.png" alt="Stage Floorplates">
<br><br>
  Whilst retracting the spring catch with one finger lower the other end of the Floor Plate onto the locating pin on the sub-frame. Ensure the pin is inserted into the hole in the floor plate. If the pin does not engage, make sure the sub-frame is pressed tightly against the edge of the plate and is parallel - now release the Spring Catch.
  Now position the next Sub-Frame so that its Locating Pin lines up with the Locating Pin Hole on the Floor Plate, lower the Floor Plate into position and release the spring catch.
  For the first few installations it may be necessary to stand on the edge of the floor plate(allowing the Spring Catch pins to engage).

  <br>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/devices/freestanding/xstage_floorplates4.png" alt="Stage Floorplates">
  <br>

  Continue to fit the remaining Floor Plates in the same way, securing each with its Spring Catches before moving onto the next. Once the plate is in place, if it does not completely engage, remember to stand on the corner of the Floor Plate and exert force. To check whether the plates are secure, try lifting them out of place – if correctly installed, they will not disengage.
  <br><br>
  You can leave off the one Floor Plate with a notch, since that will be installed once the pole is in.

  <br>

  <br>

  You have now completed the Main Frame assembly. Disassembly of the Floor Plates is the reverse of the assembly procedure. Make sure you pull in the Spring Catches when removing the floor plates.

  <summary><strong>Bearing unit explanation</strong></summary>

    It is important to understand the Bearing Unit’s operation as this will help when assembling and disassembling the pole.

    The Bearing Unit has two sections; an upper angled section (Cone) with 3x M8 hex screws and a lower flat section (Bearing Body) which has a slot for positioning the bearing unit in the main frame.
  
  <br>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/devices/freestanding/xstage_bearing_unit.png" alt="Stage Bearing Unit">
<br>

The cone section supports the pole and is secured to the pole with the 3x M8 hex screws. These hex screws are used to adjust the pole’s position in the Main Stage Frame assembly. The bearing unit comes pre-attached to the pole so you should not have to touch these, other than making sure they remain tight. 

<br><br>

The lower flat section bearing body is the part that inserts into the stage’s Bearing Carrier on the Upper Centre Plate and also supports the pole. This section includes 2x M10 hex screws which set the ‘Static/Spinning’ modes of the X-Stage Lite. When these 2x hex screws are tightened it is in ‘Static’ mode. When the hex screws are loosened, the pole is in ‘Spinning’ mode.
<br>

<br>
<br>

  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/devices/freestanding/xstage_bearing_unit_position.png" alt="Stage Bearing Unit Position">
<br>
The bearing unit is inside the lower cylinder on the bottom side of the slip ring. The 3x M8 hex screws can be accessed through the slots in the cylinder for tightening.

<br><br>

</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Static/Spin Mode</strong></summary>

To change from Static to Spin mode, using your 5mm hex key, tighten the two hex screws contained within the ‘X’ marked holes. To revert back to Spin mode, loosen the screws within the ‘X’ marked area. 
<br><br>
<strong>When removing your pole, you must ensure that the pole is placed in Static mode (screws tightened/locked) prior to removal. </strong>
<br>

<br>

Look inside the Bearing Carrier Ring on the stage top plate and you will see a pin sticking out.
<br>
Now look at the Bearing unit on the pole and you will see a slot. The pin on the Bearing carrier engages into the slot on the bearing unit.
<br>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/devices/freestanding/xstage_pin.png" alt="Stage Pin">
<br>

Insert the pole into the stage base ensuring the bottom of the pole is firmly seated in the bearing at the bottom of the main stage frame base. 

<br>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/devices/freestanding/xstage_alignment.png" alt="Stage Alignment">
<br>

Whilst inserting the pole and Bearing Unit into the Main Stage Frame, you must keep as upright and vertical as possible so that the pole locates correctly into the lower bearing in the Main Stage Frame. Slide the bearing unit down the pole into the carrier ensuring the slot locates into the protruding pin.

  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/devices/freestanding/xstage_locking.png" alt="Stage Lock Bearing">
<br>

Ensuring the bearing unit is firmly seated (Fig.11.6), tighten the Bearing Retaining (3 x M10) Screws firmly (using the 5mm Hex Key) – ensure that your bearing unit is tightened into the bearing carrier. Tighten progressively – first lightly tighten each screw – then re-tighten all three firmly.
<br>

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Cabling</strong></summary>
    Rotate the slip ring to a position where the protruding screw seats itself into one of the bolt holes in the stage bearing carrier. Find a location where the cables can make as direct of a path as possible to the center of the floor plate. You may need to rearrange the floor plates. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Then, carefully install the last floor plate so that the cable safely fits in the notch and the ends of the cable are accessible on the outside of the stage. 
    <br>
