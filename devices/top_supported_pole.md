## Installation

### Step 1. Decide Which Mount to Install First

- If you **must align with a ceiling beam**, install the top mount first.  
- If you **must center on a stage**, install the bottom mount first.

### Step 2. Install the First Mount

1. Position the mount (top or bottom) in the desired location.  
2. **Bottom Mount**: Use the four flange holes—there’s no longer a center hole.  
3. **Top Mount**: Adjust for angled ceilings if needed.  

### Step 3. Insert the Pole to Mark the Second Mount

1. Place the pole into the installed mount.  
2. Hold or support the free end of the pole vertically, ensuring smooth spin.  
3. Mark the holes where the second mount will be attached.

### Step 4. Install the Second Mount

1. Drill any required pilot holes for mounting hardware.  
2. Secure the second mount firmly.  
3. Check that the pole remains straight and can rotate freely.

### Step 5. Plug in Power and Data at the Top

1. With the pole fully seated in both mounts, connect the **power** and **data** cables at the top.  
2. Note that the top connector can spin freely with the pole.  
3. Keep the pole’s power supply near the top mount.

### Step 6. Connect to the PoleFX Player

1. Use an **Ethernet/network cable** to connect the Player to the pole.  
2. Plug in and power on the Player.  
3. Wait about a minute for the system to boot. (You’ll see a brief purple flash on the pole before the full light show begins.)
