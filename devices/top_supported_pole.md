## Step 3. Mark Location of Top Support

1. Insert the pole into the bottom mount and stand it up vertically.
2. Slide the top support up to make contact with the top surface. The angle of the top mount can be adjusted to accommodate angled ceilings.
3. Using a level, verify that the pole is straight.
4. Mark the center points of the top slots to drill pilot holes in the top surface.

## Step 5. Plug Cables into Top

1. With the pole inserted into both mounted bearings, plug in the power and data connector to the top of the pole. This connector is able to spin independently from the rest of the pole.
2. Connect the pole's power supply and store it nearby the top of the pole.
