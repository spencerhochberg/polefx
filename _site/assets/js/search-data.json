With the cable connected, carefully slide the top section into position. Be sure to align hex heads with the holes in the top pole section. When the sections are aligned, tighten the two set screws in the pole coupling. To remove the pole sections, loosen the set screws all the way and then tighten them back in one turn. This should allow the sections to be freed again. Input Connections . A power and data input are both required. The power supply is 5V, 12A. The data connection is a Cat5/6 network cable, to connect to a media server or PoleFX player. Final Steps . When the pole gets power, it flashes at the ends to show it is booting.
