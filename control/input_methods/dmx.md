# DMX Control Mode

The PoleFX Player uses 9 DMX channels to control various functions. To set up DMX:

1. Connect to the PoleFX Player's web app at `http://polefx.local`.
2. Go to the settings page.
3. On the settings page, ensure that the DMX option is enabled.
4. Configure the start channel.

Use the "Monitor Serial" checkbox to verify incoming DMX signals. Disable it during normal operation for optimal performance.

| Pin | Function |
