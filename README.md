# PoleFX Documentation using just-the-docs-template

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a [Jekyll] site that:

- uses the [Just the Docs] theme;
- can be built and published on [GitHub Pages];
- can be built and previewed locally, and published on other platforms.


Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:
1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.
2.  Run `bundle install`.
3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.
